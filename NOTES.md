# Notes

## Routing captures

Turns out compile time string literal parsing is possible.


## Resource handling

This is an issue for later/

I really like how phoenix does resources with the elixir modules. Im thinking of
a macro which does basically the same thing on a struct with asociated funcs or
maybe just allow them to pass in all the functions for it.
