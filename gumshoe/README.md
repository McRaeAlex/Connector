# Gumshow

A bug tracking application written to both test and track the bugs of the 
connector project.

## To do

* Basic CRUD only for issues. Then worry about other stuff.

## Lazy Static version

Arguable the lazy static version is much prettier becuase the functions don't 
hang off of a single struct which provides the resources but I will continue 
with the orginal plan because I believe it is more likely people will do that
in practice.
